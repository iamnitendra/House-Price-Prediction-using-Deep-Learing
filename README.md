# House-Price-Prediction-using-Deep-Learing
We will understand the problem of a real estate company from its CEO and then apply ML to solve it.
In this project I will be walking you through analyzing the problem from collecting data, importing it to a Jupyter notebook,
looking for promising attributes, finding out correlations, plotting graphs, creating a pipeline, dealing with missing values and much more.
At the end we present the problem to the real estates company who will use the model for predicting house prices given a set of features.
We will see how concepts like cross validation, train-test splitting, stratified shuffle split, cross validation and sampling work in action.


# Objective
Predict the house price
Using two different models in terms of minimizing the difference between predicted and actual rating
